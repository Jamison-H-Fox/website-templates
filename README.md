# Megaphone Website Templates

This repo contains a library of reusable components that can be quickly duplicated to create a simple static website.

I've used this template to make websites for three small businesses. All of the data that's unique to each business is stored in the data.js file. This enables me to make changes in one centralized place in the code, and those changes will push to their respective components.

I intend to continue development on this project and eventually grow it into a small side business.
